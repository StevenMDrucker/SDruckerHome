Personal Profile
---------

Dr. Steven M Drucker has a 30+ year career in computer research and development focusing on graphics, interfaces, and information visualization. In the course of his research, he has developed prototypes, products, and websites; managed several groups; published over 100 papers; and filed over 130 patents.

Currently, he is a Partner and Researcher Manager of the Visualization and Interactive Data Analysis (VIDA) group at Microsoft Research (MSR). He is also an affiliate professor at the University of Washington Computer Science and Engineering Department. His research focuses on where human computer interaction meets data: democratizing the process of understanding and explaining information through the creation of tools that facilitate discovery and communication of insights using natural interaction and storytelling techniques.

Before coming to Microsoft, he received his Ph.D. from the Computer Graphics and Animation Group at the MIT Media Lab in May 1994. His thesis research was on intelligent camera control interfaces for graphical environments. Dr. Drucker graduated Magna Cum Laude with Honors in Neurosciences from Brown University where he also worked with the Brown Graphics Group and went on to complete his masters at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT doing research in robot learning.

He has demonstrated his work on stage with Satya Nadella at the Microsoft CEO Summit and with Bill Gates at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and Microsoft&#39;s Worldwide Marketing Conference. He has shipped numerous products including a project for visualizing large datasets and another project for gathering and acting on information collected from the web; was written up in the New York Times; filed over 130 patents; and published papers on technologies as diverse as exploratory search, information visualization, multi-user environments, online social interaction, hypermedia research, human and robot perceptual capabilities, robot learning, parallel computer graphics, spectator oriented gaming, and human interfaces for camera control.
